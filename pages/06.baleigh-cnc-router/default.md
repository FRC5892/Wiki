title: 'Baleigh CNC Router'
---

The Baleigh router has a funny Gcode implementation that does not support curves.  The post processor MUST be configured to output short line segments instead of arcs.

Make sure to located the 0,0 coordinates for your part at a know location.  I suggest a corner!
Secure your stock to the router bed, making sure that its inside the cutting envelope!
	Use one or more of: double stick tape, blue tape+superglue, or brass screws.
    Planning in a step where you drill holes and pause for installing screws is a GREAT idea!
Make sure that no clamps or screws are located where they will get cut or hit by the router head.
	Consider doing an air cut with the head zeroed 50mm above the stock top surface.
After power up and homing, move the router head to the planned 0,0 location on your stock and zero X and Y.
Move near the middle of your stock, place the sensing puck on the stock, and run the Z touch routine.
Run the program
Glory in your minion's work!
