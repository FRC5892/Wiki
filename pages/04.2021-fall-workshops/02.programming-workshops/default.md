title: 'Programming Workshops'

## Summary

This year we were gifted with a number of interested and dedicated programming recruits. We knew that lots of time had to be spent on training before the season started to facilitate a collaborative programming environment. Although we tried teaching from the front of the classroom, we quickly found that the more advanced content (GitHub/Version Control and WPILIB) was better taught by providing members with time, support, and guided resources to learn at their own pace. By Workshop 3, we reduced programming workshop attendance from an unmanageable 30 to a much more palatable 10 and significantly increased the number of programming workshops we could have by running programming workshops concurrently to other workshops. Additionally, we had successfully transitioned to a self paced learning model. By Mock Season, team leadership had decided to cap the programming subteam to 5 individuals (including leadership) to reduce strain on programming leadership and because they felt short on membership for other more resource intensive subteams.

A typical (post workshop 2) programming workshop started by "stealing" Ms. Baird's laptop cart (which we had been using since the second programming meeting) and letting members work through the GitHub and Spectrum resources with the Programming Captain and Deputy Programming Captain fielding questions, and providing enrichment and general guidance as needed.

## First Workshop: Intro to Java

#### What we did

For the first workshop, we presented [Spectrum C1,1 Intro to Java Programming ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MxjAYEkdW9MVuQUSKM9xFdQ3vQl-1MXcdd2jdfOI_KY/edit%23slide%3Did.g9267f80ec3_1_80&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1636501843524000&usg=AOvVaw2H4hQkvQSZkjlk6Cr1mXNB) from the front of the classroom and had members complete the included java challenges at class pace.

#### What worked

The [Spectrum C1,1 Intro to Java Programming ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MxjAYEkdW9MVuQUSKM9xFdQ3vQl-1MXcdd2jdfOI_KY/edit%23slide%3Did.g9267f80ec3_1_80&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1636501843524000&usg=AOvVaw2H4hQkvQSZkjlk6Cr1mXNB) had good content and the challenges ensured that members could learn in a more hands on manner

#### What didn't work

With 30 members attending, it was hard to give everyone the individual attention that they needed. Additionally, the lack of planning hit when we realized that the font used for the short links had fairly similar looking Is Ls and 1s. This might have worked better as a self paced workshop. We could have also used more skilled members to assist struggling members as we struggled to give all 30 attendees the individual attention they needed.

## Second Workshop: Intro to Git and GitHub
! This workshop was ultimately a failure and needed to be reworked and rerun. The next run of the workshop was successful and is detailed below
#### What we did

We had members create GitHub accounts, install GitHub desktop, and read through a GitHub resource. We then attempted to coach all 30 of them through forking, editing, committing, and pull requesting a change on a team training repository.

#### What worked

(intentionally left blank)

#### What didn't work

Most of the workshop. I cam in unprepared and didn't give clear enough directions. Additionally, having 30 people create pull requests on the same repository with poor directions lead to an unmanageable amount of merge conflicts and an overall lack of understanding. 

## Third Workshop: Intro to Git and GitHub Round 2
!!! This workshop was a reworked version of Intro to Git and GitHub
#### What we did

For this workshop we came in prepared with a set of slides on the basics of Git and GitHub created by Vincent Wren and the [Git and GitHub first-timers](https://lab.github.com/lmachens/git-and-github-first-timers) learning pathway. Additionally, this workshop was run concurrently to another workshop which helped cut down on attendance from those who were less interested (approximately 10 members attended instead of 30). We started the workshop by presenting the set of slides, and then let members work through the pathway independently, providing encouragement and assistance as needed.

#### What worked

The self paced model seemed to work a lot better for many members than my poorly planned and executed front of the classroom teaching.

#### What didn't work

I didn't spend a lot of time reviewing Vincent's slides so I didn't present them very well. The slides also covered material that the GitHub learning pathway covered, so they probably weren't necessary.

## Remaining Workshops: GitHub Labs and WPILib Self Paced Work Time

#### What we did

For the remaining workshops we provided space, resources, time, and support to encourage members to work through the self paced materials. At the fourth workshop, we started assigning members who finished the GitHub labs to work through the spectrum slides as they provide a solid foundation in WPILib Java command based programming.

#### What worked

This seemed to cater to the needs of most members and gave me more time to take care of other team responsibilities.

#### What didn't work

Some members were not really motivated to work through the content. Announcing that subteam membership would be determined based on workshop progress might have helped.

## Programming Mock Season: Programming the 2020/2021 Robot

#### What we did

For the mock programming season, we provided members with [Nevin Morrison's WPILib Java Command Based Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1794CxHQoQg&list=PLYwJIUT_B-n612Gqmfsq1ukYLa6WKgonc) and tasked them with creating their own code to run the 2020/2021 season competition robot. 

#### What worked

All 3 new members had driving robot code by the end of the mock season.

#### What didn't work

There wasn't enough emphasis placed on programming the physical robot so for most of the mock season the members tested their code in the WPILib simulator, a useful skill to have, but one that had already been practiced.
