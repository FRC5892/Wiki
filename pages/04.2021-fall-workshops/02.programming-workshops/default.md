title: 'Programming Workshops'
---

## Summary

This year we were gifted with a number of interested and dedicated programming recruits. We knew that lots of time had to be spent on training before the season started to facilitate a collaborative programming environment. Although we started trying to teach from the front of the classroom, we quickly found that the more advanced content (GitHub/Version Control and WPILIB) was better taught by providing members with time, support, and guided resources to learn at their own pace. By Workshop 3, we reduced programming workshop attendance from an unmanageable 30 to a much more palatable 10, significantly increased the number of workshops we could have by running programming workshops concurrently with other workshops, and had successfully transitioned to a self paced learning model.

A typical (post workshop 2) programming workshop started by "stealing" Ms. Baird's laptop cart (which we had been using since the second programming meeting) and letting members work through the GitHub and Spectrum resources with the Programming Captain and Deputy Programming Captain fielding questions, and providing enrichment and general guidance as needed. 

## Resources Used

[Spectrum Training Materials](https://training.spectrum3847.org) <br>
[Git and GitHub first-timers](https://lab.github.com/lmachens/git-and-github-first-timers)

## First Workshop: Intro to Java

#### What we did

For the first workshop, we presented [Spectrum Control System C1.1-C2.5](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MxjAYEkdW9MVuQUSKM9xFdQ3vQl-1MXcdd2jdfOI_KY/edit%23slide%3Did.g9267f80ec3_1_80&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1636501843524000&usg=AOvVaw2H4hQkvQSZkjlk6Cr1mXNB) from the front of the clasroom and had members complete the java challenges at class pace.

#### What worked

The slides had good content and the challenges ensured that members could learrn in a more hands on manner

#### What didn't work

With 30 members attending, it was hard to give everyone the individual attention that they needed. Additionally, the lack of planning hit when we realized that the font used for the short links had fairly similar looking Is Ls and 1s. This might have worked better as a self paced workshop. We could have also used more skilled members to assist struggling members as we struggled to give all 30 attendees the individual attention they needed.

## Second Workshop: Intro to Git and GitHub
! This workshop was ultimately a failure and needed to be reworked and rerun. The next run of the workshop was successful and is detailed below
#### What we did

We had members create GitHub accounts, install GitHub desktop, and read through a GitHub resource (I forget which one). We then attempted to coach all 30 of them through forking, editing, committing, and pull requesting a change on a team training repository.

#### What worked

(intentionally left blank)

#### What didn't work

Most of the workshop. I cam in unprepared and didn't give clear enough directions. Additionally, having 30 people create pull requests on the same repository with poor directions lead to quite a few merge conflicts and an overall lack of understanding. 

## Third Workshop: Intro to Git and GitHub Round 2
!!! This workshop was a reworked version of Intro to Git and GitHub
#### What we did

For this workshop we came in prepared with a set of slides created by Vincent Wren and the [Git and GitHub first-timers](https://lab.github.com/lmachens/git-and-github-first-timers) learning pathway. Additionally, this workshop was run concurrent to another workshop which helped cut down on attendance from those who were less interested (approximately 10 members attended instead of 30). We startetd the workshop by presenting the set of slides, and then let members work through the pathway at their own pace, providing encouragement and enrichment as needed.

#### What worked

The self paced model seemed to work a lot better for many members than my poorly planned and executed front of the clasroom teaching.

#### What didn't work

The only thing that didn't really work was the presentation of the slides. I didn't spend a lot of time reviewing the slides so I didn't present them very well.

## Remaining Workshops: GitHub Labs and WPILib Self Paced Work Time

#### What we did

For the reamining workshops we provided space, resources, time, and support to encourage members to work through the self paced materials. At the fourth workshop, we started assigning members who finished the GitHub labs to work through the spectrum slides as they provide a solid foundation in WPILib Java command based progragmming.

#### What worked

This seemed to cater to the needs of most members and didn't tie up all of my time.

#### What didn't work

Some members were still not incredibly motivated to work through the content. Some sort of prize or announcement about how subteam membership would be determined might have helped.
