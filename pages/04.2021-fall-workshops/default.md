title: '2021 Fall Workshops'
---
After losing lots of team knowledge and experience over the pandemic, we knew that it was more important than ever before to hit the road running wtih a strong set of workshops to bring our team of 30 new members and less than 10 experienced members up to speed. We hosted 16 different workshops on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:05PM to 5:00PM, leading up to a mock season.
